The reading before reminds us the exact confidence bounds in hybrid censoring [@chen1987] , maybe we can compare the conditional variance here. Here we also include the discussion on [@balakrishnan2013].

## Introduction

Denote $D^*$ and $D$, the numbers of units that would fail before $T^*$ and $T$, respectively, and set

$$
\begin{align}
S&=\sum_{i=1}^{D^*}X_{i,n}+(n-D^*)T^* \quad &D^* >1 \\
&=nT & D^*=0
\end{align}
$$ which is called total time on test. Thus, the hybrid censored data from exponential distribution.

## Dicussion of $\hat{\theta}$

> Lemma 2.1 [@chen1987] The conditional mgf of $\hat{\theta}$, $\phi_{\hat{\theta}}(w)$ is 

$$
\begin{align}
\phi_{\hat{\theta}}(w) &=(1-q^n)^{-1}\bigg(\sum_{}\bigg)
\end{align}
$$
